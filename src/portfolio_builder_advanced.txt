## Requirements
The purpose of the program is to build a fund portfolio for each customer based on their age and assets available for investments. 

The portfolios are created using a set of age based models. 

Each age based model will specify 1 fund from each of the 3 categories (Equity, Bond, Cash) for a total of 3 funds and 
will dictate the percentage of the customer portfolio that should be allocated (e.g. 80% Equity, 10% Cash, 10% Bond). 

The inputs to the program will be a list of funds with prices and a list of customers with their assets and date of birth. 
The program will need to read in each customer record, choose the correct portfolio model based on the age of the customer 
and create an allocation of funds using the fund list.  The output of the program will be a portfolio file with a record 
for each customer with the share amounts of each fund selected.

* The funds in each customer portfolio will be allocated based on the appropriate age based model
* When there are multiple funds in each category to choose from rotate equally through them when assigning to a customer portfolio
* When there is an error processing a customer record report the error skip the record and continue processing the rest
